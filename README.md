🔀 Merging Git Branches to Main
This document explains the process to merge multiple branches into the main branch after completing work (like bug fixes or feature additions).

🗂️ Scenario
You have several branches (like bugfix-1, feature-login, etc.) and you want to:

Pull the latest updates from main

Fix issues or add features on other branches

Merge those branches back into main when done
